# Remixing-with-React Forecast Dashboard

## Project Description
To create a city search forecast application that searches for any location's weather forecast with real time updates using Reactjs.

* This project applies HTMl, CSS, Javascript, and Javascript ES6 applications that are applicable with Reactjs. With the use of Javascript, we utilize state and props to assess API data from user city input request and return data values for weather information that is realistic and projected on application landing page.

## User Story

* User should be able to operate a previously reimplemented project that is now utilizing React. Users should be able to add new cities in the search field and interact with the returned data in a dynamic manner.

## Demo Features:
* The following image and gif shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
